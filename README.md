# builderbob

Hello! This is bob. Very much similar to Bob the builder. 

What does it do?
It interfaces the build and release transformations for a package. 
This enable the developer to develop with a simple command:

```commandline
build-bob
```

Hence no matter, whether you are on a java, python or any other code repo,
you just need to type the command and it handles the build execution for you!

Simple!
